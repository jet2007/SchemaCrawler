--- Configuration Options ---
Command-line options will override configuration file options.

SchemaCrawler configuration reads a resource called
schemacrawler.config.properties from the CLASSPATH, which
includes the lib/ folder. You can modify the default settings
in this file. 

The order of loading configuration settings is:
1. From a CLASSPATH resource called
   schemacrawler.config.properties
2. Which can be overridden by settings in a 
   configuration file (see below)
3. Which can be overridden by other command-line options

-g=<config-file> (short for -configfile <config-file>)
  Reads SchemaCrawler configuration properties from <config-file>
  Optional, uses the default schemacrawler.config.properties file
  in the current directory, or in-built default options
